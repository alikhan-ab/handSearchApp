# handSearchApp
 A group project for the Senior Project I and Senior Project II courses.
 handSearchApp is a reverse sign language app for iOS that allows searching for signs in Russian Sign language by demonstrating a handshape in front of a mobile phoneâ€™s camera. In addition, it is possible to fingerspell a word or translate regular Russian language words into Russian Sign Language.
 
- The Russian Sign language vocabulary was taken from [Spreadthesign website](https://www.spreadthesign.com). 
- CoreData was used for working with the vocabulary.
- Create ML was used to transform pre-trained models used for handshape recognition to CoreML.
- The models for handshape recognition were obtained by applying transfer learning to [Deep Hand](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Koller_Deep_Hand_How_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf) pre-trained model.
 
 ## Search by Handshapes
 The main functionally of the application is the ability to search for signs by the handshapes that are used to form them.

 One of the drawbacks of the current implementations is that the application doesn't detect hand position and only classifies an area in the middle of the frame.
 

 
## Search by Fingerspelling
In addition, the user can fingerspell a word to search for its sign-in Russian Sign Language.

In one of the previous implementations, both models used in Search by Handshapes and Search by Fingerspelling were hosted on a server.

 ## Search by Words and Category
Finally, the application can be used as a regular Russian to Russian Sign Language dictionary.

## Important
This repo doesn't contain all videos from the Russian Sign Language, instead, it uses a placeholder video.
